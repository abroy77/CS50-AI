data from german traffic sign recognition benchmark [ GTSRB dataset ](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/x/projects/5/gtsrb.zip)

Experiment details:
I've done some DL courses before so not bothering with too much tinkering. 
Wrote a basic 2 conv layers 1 FCN layer model. no bells and whistles. works well enough since the images are small and the dataset is not too big.
